## Downloading Dataset
In order to experiment with NYC taxi trip dataset, download the 'Yellow Taxi Trip Records' for January 2009 from the site: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page. Put the downloaded CSV file inside this folder 'data/taxi_trip'. The file name should be 'yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv'. Other datasets are available under 'data' folder.
